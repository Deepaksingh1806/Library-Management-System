# Library-Management-System

A library management system project is a computerized system to digitize and automate library operations, replacing manual, paper-based record-keeping. Its goal is to efficiently manage book catalogs, member information, and transactions (issuing and returning books). Key features include user authentication for different roles (admin, librarian, user), a book search function, and automated tracking of due dates and fines to reduce errors and workload.
